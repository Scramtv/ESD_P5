- drones have become a big issue in the US
- cause of 2/3 of near midair collissions are caused by drones
- airports need more safety
- a drone flew into the Super Scooper, a plane used to fight wildfires in USA. The FAA (federal aviation
adminstration) had restricted flying near the wildfire, though the drone hobbyist chose to do it anyway
resulting in a hole in the plane's left wing.

The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, has introduced both 
opportunities and challenges for modern societies. While drones are increasingly employed in fields such as logistics, 
photography, infrastructure inspection, and emergency response, their accessibility and affordability have also raised 
serious concerns regarding safety and security. A growing issue is the unauthorized use of drones in restricted or 
sensitive airspace, particularly around airports. Even small drones can pose a significant risk to civil aviation by 
disrupting air traffic, causing flight delays, and in worst-case scenarios, leading to mid-air collisions.

Globally, incidents of drones entering restricted airspace near airports have been steadily increasing over the past decade.
These events highlight vulnerabilities in traditional air traffic management systems, which were not originally designed to
account for small, low-flying aerial vehicles. The challenge lies in both tracking drones—detecting and following their 
position in real time—and pointing systems—ensuring accurate identification and response to potential threats. 
The combination of high air traffic density and the unpredictability of drone incursions makes airports one of the most 
critical environments for addressing this issue.

In Denmark, the problem of drone-related airspace violations has become a matter of growing concern. As a country with busy 
international hubs such as Copenhagen Airport (Kastrup), drone incursions can have a disproportionately large impact on 
national and regional air traffic. Denmark has already experienced several incidents in which unauthorized drones have forced 
the temporary suspension of flights, resulting in economic losses, passenger disruption, and increased security measures. 
Moreover, Denmark’s strong emphasis on digitalization and technology adoption has made drone ownership more widespread, 
further elevating the risk of misuse—whether intentional or accidental.

Addressing the issue of drones in airport environments in Denmark requires an integrated approach that combines effective 
tracking technologies, regulatory frameworks, and operational procedures. This project focuses on exploring the technical 
and strategic aspects of tracking and pointing at drones in restricted airspace, with an emphasis on the Danish context. 
By analyzing both the challenges and potential solutions, the project aims to contribute to a safer and more resilient 
airspace system in Denmark.
